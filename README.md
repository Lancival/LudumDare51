# Time To Live: 10
## About
Time To Live: 10 is a short puzzle-platformer in which a couple of cubes try to reach a battery. The catch? The cubes explode and respawn every 10 seconds. Fortunately, these cubes are special - they record their movement through space and time and will repeat those movements on the next try, allowing you to use the as platforms to jump futher!

TTL:10 has 10 levels plus one bonus stage. All code, art, and sound effects were created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 51. You can play the game at https://lancival.itch.io/ttl10!

## Controls
Mouse and keyboard only:
- W or Left Arrow keys to move left.
- D or Right Arrow keys to move right.
- Space bar to jump.
- Q and E to cycle between different cubes (only while the timer isn't running).

If you get stuck, you can reset the level in the menu, or skip to another via level select.
