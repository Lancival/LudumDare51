# Time To Live: 10
Time To Live: 10 is a short puzzle-platformer in which a couple of cubes try to reach a battery. The catch? The cubes explode and respawn every 10 seconds. Fortunately, these cubes are special - they record their movement through space and time and will repeat those movements on the next try!

This game was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare.
