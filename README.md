# Time To Live: 10
## About
Time To Live: 10 is a short puzzle-platformer in which a couple of cubes try to reach a battery. The catch? The cubes explode and respawn every 10 seconds. Fortunately, these cubes are special - they record their movement through space and time and will repeat those movements on the next try, allowing you to use them as platforms to jump futher!

TTL:10 has 10 levels plus one bonus stage. Code, art, and sound effects were created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 51. You can play the game in your browser at https://lancival.itch.io/ttl10! Windows and Mac builds are also available there.

## Controls
Mouse and keyboard only:
- A or Left Arrow keys to move left.
- D or Right Arrow keys to move right.
- Space bar to jump.
- Q and E to cycle between different cubes (only while the timer isn't running).

If you get stuck, you can reset the level in the menu, or skip to another via level select.
